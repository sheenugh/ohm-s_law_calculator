# =========== PSEUDO CODE ==========
# || ACTUAL CODE ||
# - Ask the user what they want to calculate: Voltage, Current, or Resistance.
print("What do you want to calculate?\n1 = Voltage\n2 = Current\n3 = Resistance\nPick from 1-3")
ask_what_to_calculate = input("Input your choice here: ")

# # - Formulas
# voltage = current * resistance

# - Ask user for the values of the remaining variables or quantities.
# - Computation using conditional statement
# - Printing the result
